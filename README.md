An attractive shooter game using pygame

You can use assets as main particles and gameplay characters.
There is sound required to make the game attractive.
Make valid changes if necessary.
Just edit assets to personalize the game.
Transfer audio files to a folder named audio.
Transfer the png files to a folder named assets.

Thank You
